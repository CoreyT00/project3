Chessboard data structure:

For my chessboard inplementaion I decided to use a 2D array to represnt this structure.
This 2D array is of type Char* and is represented like this: char* board[EIGHT][EIGHT]. The
'EIGHT' is a const global int variable. The reason why I went with is data structure is because i believe that it is the easiest way to think/visualize the chessboard. It allowed my to easily understand conceptually how I could approach coding solution and implement specific algorithms (searching, moves, deletes, etc).
